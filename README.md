Unfortunately the source code for Booked Scheduler is no longer being distributed and version 2.8.5 seems to have been the last open source relase, see https://www.bookedscheduler.com/the-future-of-booked/ and https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpscheduleit/files/ "Booked Scheduler will become a ful SaaS offering on November 1, 2020. This open source project will be discontinued. "

THIS IS ONLY A FORK AND THEREFORE WILL NOT BE WORKED ON.
